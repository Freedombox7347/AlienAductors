#App Directory for appliaction files

##CakePHP Framework
CakePHP framw is being used for this project. As such please follow the conventioncs for your work located at 

**http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/intro/conventions.html**

Copy the scr folder into you Cake deployment directory for the application and replace the current src folder.

  **Probably want to delete the source folder before you copy just to make sure it is clean**
  
  You will still need to setup your own database and configure the cake connection information. I am using the app user that is made with the user script from the dbscripts folder for my appliation connection to the database.
