###Description   
  New to this world is a company known to abduct willing humans for rides in outer space.  Being that this is so popular the organization needs to have a way to track customer reviews to figure out if the all too willing human abductees are having a good time or not.

Our proposed app will allow the company to take in customer reviews on the various abduction offerings based on how liked the experience was for the customer. Once stored a Alien Abduction Customer Representative will be able to be recall  and review customer feedback from inside the app to show how many people thoroughly enjoyed their outer space abduction or how many people just didnâ€™t like the experience.
